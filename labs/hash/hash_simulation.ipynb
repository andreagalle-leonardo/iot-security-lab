    "### What is a Hash Function?\n",
    "Unlike encryption, which is two-way (encrypt -> decrypt), a hash function is a **one-way** mathematical process. It takes input data of *any* size (a short password, a 4GB movie file) and condenses it into a fixed-size string of characters, usually represented in hexadecimal. This output is called a **digest**, **fingerprint**, or simply a **hash**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties we will explore:\n",
    "1.  **Deterministic:** The same input always produces the exact same hash.\n",
    "2.  **Avalanche Effect:** A tiny change in the input results in a massive, unpredictable change in the output.\n",
    "3.  **Pre-image Resistance (One-Way):** It is computationally infeasible to reverse the process (to determine the original input from the hash alone).\n",
    "4.  **Collision Resistance:** It is highly unlikely to find two different inputs that produce the same hash."
