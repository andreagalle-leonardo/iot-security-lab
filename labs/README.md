3.  **Run the Cells:** Follow the instructions inside the notebook, running the code cells sequentially to complete the exercises.

## List of Exercises

### 1. DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)
Explore [how to secure UDP-based communications](./dtls/), which are common in IoT environments due to their low overhead.
